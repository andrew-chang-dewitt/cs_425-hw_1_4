    %% LAUNCHPAD
    %% ---
    %% Rule: A launchpad hosts multiple launches over time, and each launch is hosted by exactly one launchpad. Therefore, Launchpads will be created in the database even before the first launch is hosted there.
    %% Rule: A launchpad is located in a country, and a country, in turn, is located on a continent.
    %% Rule: Each launchpad has a name and a location.

    %% LAUNCH
    %% ---
    %% Rule: A launch requires a launchpad that hosts it, a launch vehicle (the rocket), and the payload.
    %% Rule: For a launch, the date, time and name should be recorded as well as whether it is a crewed launch or not.
    %% Rule: Each launch is performed by a launch vehicle. The serial number for the launch vehicle should be recorded. A launch vehicle can perform multiple launches over time.
