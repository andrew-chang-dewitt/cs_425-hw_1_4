    %% LAUNCHPAD
    %% ---
    %% Rule: A launchpad hosts multiple launches over time, and each launch is hosted by exactly one launchpad. Therefore, Launchpads will be created in the database even before the first launch is hosted there.

    %% Rule: Each launch is performed by a launch vehicle. The serial number for the launch vehicle should be recorded. A launch vehicle can perform multiple launches over time.
